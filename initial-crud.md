* **Create** a fantasy team by picking available NFL players from a list.
---
* **Read** the NFL teams that belong to the other players in that fantasy league.
* **Read** previous and upcoming matchups between the NFL teams in their fantasy league.
---
* **Update** their team roster for upcoming matchups (e.g. move up some players from the bench).
* **Update** their profile information.
---
* **Delete** their account.
* **Delete** their fantasy team.
* **Delete** their fantasy league (if they are the designated league owner who created the fantasy league).
